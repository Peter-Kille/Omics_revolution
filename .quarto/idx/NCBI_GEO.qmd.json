This process is outside the scope of this workshop but if you are interested [Andres et al 2013](https://cf.sharepoint.com/:b:/t/SystemsBiology/EQ_8U8YJ9i9Fg0bKPo6PmO4Bec8KxoXp6zIco-L5z-_55g?e=Hme6hj0) Provides an excellent overview of the processes involved.\n\n![Process Overview](images/Process_Overview.png) Figure 1.

You will not need to derive the mathematical formula underpinning these concepts or deploy the algorithums from first principles since the software you will use does this for you but it is worth knowing the background. There is an excellent academic from Stanford University Name Prof Josh Starmer who runs a youtube channel called [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) this deal with a large range of biological stats and has some great annotations to explain them, I am going to suggest you watch two of his videos to orientate you about the key statistical concepts for this session:\n\n## False Discover Rate\n\n<iframe data-external=\"1\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8LQSvtjcEo&amp;t=404svem\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n## Fisher's Exact Test and Enrichment Analysis\n\n<iframe data-external=\"1\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyAvvaMjfM\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n# Mining GEO database\n\n## [Geo Workshop](https://cf.sharepoint.com/:b:/t/SystemsBiology/ESRyTPUlb_dJgpHLXUbYk2wBO_SyL9gXhOXOs-BpHFSPsw?e=FXrOLC)\n\n1.  Search for you dataset\n\nGo to Geo DataSets: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/)\\[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/\\]\n\n![GEO_DataSet Search](images/GEO_DataSets.png) ***GEO_DataSet Search***\n\nnow select <Search>\n\n2.  Refine search to only show 'DataSets' and 'Series'\n\nSelect ***\\< DataSets and Series \\>*** from the left hand menu.\n\n![Refine to DataSets](images/DataSet_Selection.png) ***Refine to DataSets***\n\n3A. Select procesed dataset (should be number 3 in list and have a heat map icon to the right)\n\nClick on title ***\\< Endothelial cell response to ultrafine particles \\>*** to select DataSet\n\n![Entry Page](images/GDS2565.png) ***Entry Page***\n\nTake notes off all pertinent information about the experiment, including species and what microarray platform was used. In this case experiment was conducted on rats and analysed on an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. Download any publication available. Also, if you are interested you could have a look at the cluster analysis on the right hand site. This will show you how the relationship of the expression profiles from each sample relative to each other. If the experiment was successful, all samples of a certain treatment should cluster together.\n\n4A. Compare experiment samples\n\nClick ***\\<Compare 2 sets of sample\\>***\n\nChoose ***\\<test e.g. One-tailed t-test (A \\> B)\\>***\n\nChoose <significance level>\\_ e.g. 0.001\n\nClick on: Step 2: Select which Samples to put in Group A and Group B\n\n![Select Groups to Comnpare](images/group_compare.png) ***Select Groups to compare***\n\nChoose ***\\< Query Group A vs B \\>***\n\nYou should now see a list of the following DEGS\n\n![DEG list](images/DEGs.png) ***DEG List***\n\n5A. Download DEGs\n\nYou have \\>100 DEGs but the page only displays the first 20. Before downloading DEGS change the items per page from 20 to 500.\n\n![Items Per Page](images/Items_per_page.png) ***Items Per Page***\n\nSelect ***\\< Download profile data \\>***\n\nand you will be prompted to save the profiling of the DEGs displayed as default file name ***\\<profile_data.txt\\>***\n\nSave to appropriate location. If needed Select Page 2.... of the DEGS and repeat the download process.\n\nRepeat this process for ***\\<test e.g. One-tailed t-test (B \\> A) significance level 0.001 \\>***\\_\n\n6A. Open and Merge DEG lists in Excel\n\nThe DEG lists show the gene list with there relative expression level (normalised) and annotation for the genes involved (annotation shown in columns BG -\\>). For Our next steps we will use the Gene symbol that is in Column BH.\n\n3B. Select un-processed series (should be number 2 - it will have icon ***\\< Analyze with GEO2R \\>*** at the end of the entry)\n\nClick on ***\\< Analyze with GEO2R \\>***\n\nNow Define groups by click clicking the ***\\< Define Group pull \\>*** down and create groups 'control' and 'Treatment' (enter group name and press enter). Click on each sample in list and associated it with one of your group (you can hold ctrl down to select multiple entry before associating them with the group).\n\n![Select Groups to Compare](images/compare_groups_geo2R.png) ***Select Groups to compare***\n\n4B. Customise the Option and Analyse\n\nSelect ***\\< Options \\>*** and customise as shown below:\n\n![Geo2R Options](images/Geo2R_Options.png) ***Geo2R Options***\n\nSelect ***\\< reanalyze \\>***\n\nWill will now see a Processing icon - this may take a minute or two.\n\n5B. DEGs\n\nYou will now see a table and a series of Visualisations - review the visualisation taking note of what each are showing you.\n\n![Geo2R results](images/GEO2R_results.png) ***Geo2R results***\n\nVenn diagram showing GSE4567: Limma, Padj\\<0.05 - 704 genes - this is the set we will use\n\nClick on ***\\< Explore and download, control vs treatment and Download Significant genes \\>***\n\nThis will give you a Tsv you can open in excel\n\n6B DEG TSV\n\nOpen the DEG TSV - you will have ID (Affymetrix), Gene Symbol, Description and Log2(fold Change) and Adjusted p-value. The Gene.symbol can have multiple symonyms for each gene - this can bias future analsyis.
