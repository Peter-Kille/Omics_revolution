From 2016 (gprofiler)\\[https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost\\] and (stringdb)\\[https://string-db.org/\\] have been prefered because they have been kept upto date. However, DAVID was refunded and a 2021 update means it is back to being maintained. Although there will not be time to explore it in our workshop the following workshop and video is there to support anyone wanting to explore its functionality.\n\n## 1. Start analysis and upload you data\n\nSelect ***\\< start analysis \\>***\n\nPaste in you gene list (1) in box (A) and, select identifier (2), and identify as a Gene List (3).

Generate Functional Analysis of gene list\n\nIf you have used a non-regulate gene identifier or it does not recognize the identifier type you have used it may ask you to convert the identifiers - check the programs suggestion - it is usually good but you should check.\n\nSelect ***\\< Functional Annotation Tool \\>***\n\nYou will now be give a annotation summary as shown below:\n\n![Annotation Summary](images/david_annotation_summary.png) ***Annotation Summary***\n\nYou will see a range of categories for which the functional annotation has been performed. The analysis told has not only cross referenced the gene list against a range of functional databases it has also analysed the gene co-appearance in citations (Literature), links to disease (Disease) and Interactions agonist other linkages.\n\n## 3. Review Gene Ontology Enrichment\n\nLet us consider the functional enrichment using (Gene Ontology)\\[http://geneontology.org/\\]. Gene Ontology categorizes gene products using three distinct characteristics - Molecular Function (biochemistry of the product), Cellular Component (where it appears in the cell), and the Biological Processes - see more about these classification by reviewing the (Gene Ontology Overview documentation)\\[http://geneontology.org/docs/ontology-documentation/\\]. Although ontologies are hierarchical, they are not a simple classification system, they not only allow for gene products to be involved with multiple processes the relationship between elements in the hierarchy are closely defined. The ontology also allows for classification to be as specific or detailed as knowledge allows ie if a protein is a transporter but what it transports is not known it will be defined by a mid-level term 'transporter' but if it is known to transport Zn it will be classified at a 'Zinc transport' as well as a 'transporter'. Enrichment analysis uses fisher exact test (see about) to calculate the enrichment at each of these 'levels' - although I usually choose to look at the integrated data summarized under the 'GOTERM\\_\\[BP/CC/MF\\]\\_DIRECT'.\n\nclick on the + next too the ***\\< Gene_Ontology \\>*** category\n\nSelect ***\\< Chart \\>*** right of the GOTERM_BP_DIRECT\n\n![BP Enrichment](images/David_BP_enrichment.png) ***BP Enrichment***\n\nNote the P-value and benjamini correct p-value displaying the like hood that those specific Go terms are represented by random - i.e. lost the P-value the less likely the representation of the term is a random select , therefore the more likely the term is enriched.\n\nTo see the list of gene involved in for instance 'positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation' click on the blue bar under the 'Genes' column.\n\nThis is the list you will see:\n\n![positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation](images/osteoblast_differentiation.png) ***positive regulation of osteoblast differentiation***\n\nNow review enrichment for Cell Component and Molecular Function.\n\n## 4.

Functional Annotation Clustering\n\nDAVID attempts to summarise enrichment between categorization systems using a tool it terms - Functional annotation clustering. If you select this for you current data set. you will be provided with the following clusters:\n\n![Functional Annotation Clustering](images/Functional_Annotation_Clustering.png) ***Functional Annotation Clustering***\n\nEach cluster is assigned an enrichment score under which 'terms' that are enriched under different classification systems are displayed grouped together. Each 'grouping' is given a 'Enrichment Score' the larger the enrichment score the higher the score the more likely that cluster is being enriched. Note that the is a 'Classification Stringency' pull down menu that allows you to define the strength of associated of the term being grouped together.\n\nFor annotation Cluster 6 (which contains lots of Metallothionein/cadimum associated terms) there is a small green and black box - after the Enrichment Score and the 'G' - click on this box. This brings up a cluster matrix showing the gene gene products on the Y-axis and the classification 'vlasses' on the X-axis.\n\n![cluster matrix](images/cluster_matrix.png) ***Cluster Matrix***\n\n[David Workshop](https://cf.sharepoint.com/:b:/t/SystemsBiology/EREU-YiocCJGum6A7Nn6AJIBU0G6bvJtdrUy5m6Ba5yspg?e=M9l56F)\n\n#### [Enrichment with David Panopto](https://cardiff.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e714981c-6144-49f5-9d24-ab6b00d22977)\n\n# [STRING](https://string-db.org/)\n\n1.
