I have just modified this tutorial slightly to tailor it to our context and computer system.\n\nThe QIIME commands themselves require a computer system that has been set up for using QIIME. This kind of computing is outside of the scope of this course, so I have run the commands for you: your task will be exploring and interpreting the outputs. However, I have included the commands below so that you can see what has produced those outputs.\n\n## The study system\n\nThe data you will be using comes from a landmark study on the human microbiome (Caporaso et al., 2011. Genome Biol. 12(5):R50. doi: 10.1186/gb-2011-12-5-r50.). It followed two individuals over time, sampling the microbiota present on four body sites: each hand, the gut and the tongue.\n\nYou will see the letters EMP crop up repeatedly throughout the tutorial. This stands for Earth Microbiome Project (https://earthmicrobiome.org/), which this data comes from. The EMP was set up in 2010 with the modest (!) aim of sequencing the microbiome of everything. It produced a large number of valuable datasets, but even more usefully it produced a set of standard protocols which are still used in producing microbiome data. QIIME includes a number of options specifically for handling data produced using EMP methods (it helps that the people who wrote QIIME were also behind the EMP).\n\nOf particular note is the EMP primer set, 515F-806R. Also known as the Caporaso primers after the first author of the paper that described them, they have been tweaked over the years but remain the most commonly-used primer set for microbial community sequencing. Mention \"515-806\" to a microbial ecologist and they will nod sagely.\n\n## Metadata\n\nYou will see a file called metadata.txt. Metadata is 'data about the data' and usually includes information on what each sample is, when and where it was collected, what index tag was assigned to it, and anything else you need to know to make sense of it. QIIME requires its metadata to follow a particular format and this file has been formatted to conform to that.\n\n## Sequences\n\nThe input data was contained in a folder called emp-single-end-sequences. This contains two FASTQ files - sequences.fastq.gz has the sequence reads in it, and barcodes.fastq.gz has the barcodes (index tags) needed for demultiplexing. This is a giveaway that this data was produced quite some time ago! These days it would be extremely rare to get sequence data that hadn't already been demultiplexed by the provider.\n\nNotice that the files end with the extension .gz. This indicates that they have been gzipped: compressed to take up less space. If you try to read a gzipped file with less, head, etc., you will just see gobbledegook, but many bioinformatics programmes are capable of reading in gzipped files directly. Most real-life FASTQ files spend most of their time gzipped, simply to make them manageable.\n\n## Importing data in QIIME\n\nQIIME handles data by importing it into its own file format, called a QIIME artefact. This contains not only the data itself but a record of all the processes that it has gone through.\n\nThe first step in the analysis is to read the data in.\n\nYou will see that the import command below has backslashes at the end of each line. This isn't specific to QIIME, but a universal way to break up a complex command into multiple lines so that it's easier to read. In Linux, a backslash is called an escape character; it means \"interpret the next character literally\". Normally pressing enter at the end of a command tells the computer to run that command. Typing a backslash before pressing enter tells the computer that you literally just want a line break.\n\nLet's explore the parts of the command\n\nqiime tools import is the QIIME programme to be used\n\ntype \\``EMPSingleEndSequence`s tells QIIME the format the sequences will be in\n\n`input-path emp-single-end-sequences` gives the name of the directory the sequence files are in\n\n`output-path emp-single-end-sequences.qza` gives the name of the artefact file to be created. Note the file extension: `.qza`\n\n```         \nqiime tools import \\\n  --type EMPSingleEndSequences \\\n  --input-path emp-single-end-sequences \\\n  --output-path emp-single-end-sequences.qza\nDemultiplexing\n```\n\nAs mentioned above, this step would normally be done automatically be the sequencing centre. However, there are still occasions when it needs to be done manually.\n\nThis command takes the QIIME artefact we have just created and uses the barcode information to decide which sample each sequence belongs to. It creates another QIIME artefact containing the demultiplexed samples.\n\n```         \nqiime demux emp-single \\\n  --i-seqs emp-single-end-sequences.qza \\\n  --m-barcodes-file sample-metadata.tsv \\\n  --m-barcodes-column barcode-sequence \\\n  --o-per-sample-sequences demux.qza \\\n  --o-error-correction-details demux-details.qza\n```\n\nWe can then ask QIIME to produce some summary statistics. The output here is a .qzv: this is a QIIME visualisation file. Download a qzv and then drag and drop it into view.qiime2.org/\n\n```         \nqiime demux summarize \\\n  --i-data demux.qza \\\n  --o-visualization demux.qzv\n```\n\nHave a look at the qzv file. What does it tell you about the data?\n\n## Quality filtering and counting\n\nThe next step in the process does two things at once. Firstly, it quality checks the data. It removes any PhiX reads leftover from the sequencing, checks for low quality reads, and removes chimeras (hybrid reads created when two PCR products get erroneously stuck together). Secondly, it counts how many times each unique sequence (ASV) occurs in each sample.\n\nQIIME offers a few different pipelines for this step, but we are going to use one called DADA2. This is the most computationally intensive step, so be prepared for it to take up to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nHave a look at the help page for this command at https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.8/plugins/available/dada2/denoise-single/\n\nWhat are the p-trim-left and p-trunc-len options doing? Would there be a better way to have dealt with this problem in the data? HINT: it would need to be done before reading into QIIME!\n\n```         \nqiime dada2 denoise-single \\\n  --i-demultiplexed-seqs demux.qza \\\n  --p-trim-left 0 \\\n  --p-trunc-len 120 \\\n  --o-representative-sequences rep-seqs.qza \\\n  --o-table table.qza \\\n  --o-denoising-stats stats.qza\n```\n\nThis command produces three outputs. One is the table (how many reads per ASV per sample). Another is the representative sequences: for each ASV, it marries up the identifier with the actual sequence. Finally, there are some stats on the process.\n\nHaving produced our outputs, we can run some summaries to see how it's gone.\n\n```         \nqiime feature-table summarize \\\n  --i-table table.qza \\\n  --o-visualization table.qzv \\\n  --m-sample-metadata-file sample-metadata.tsv\n\nqiime feature-table tabulate-seqs \\\n  --i-data rep-seqs.qza \\\n  --o-visualization rep-seqs.qzv\n```\n\nLook at these qzv files. What information does each give you?\n\n## Taxonomy assignment\n\nHaving counted the number of times each sequence occurs in each sample, we really want to know what organism that sequence came from. QIIME uses a machine learning tool (a Naive Bayes classifier, if you're into that kind of thing) to assign a taxonomic identity to each sequence. The classifier is trained by giving it a database of sequences of known identity. This approach is endlessly flexible, as you can train the classifier to any type of sequence you are interested in. However, we will be using a pre-trained classifier as our data relates to a commonly-used 16S rRNA region. This classifier has been trained on the Silva database of 16S rRNA genes, focussing in just on the 515-806 region targeted by our primers.\n\n```         \nqiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \\\n  --i-classifier silva-138-99-515-806-nb-classifier.qza\\\n  --i-reads rep-seqs.qza \\\n  --o-classification taxonomy.qza\n\nqiime metadata tabulate \\\n  --m-input-file taxonomy.qza \\\n  --o-visualization taxonomy.qzv\n```\n\n## Barplots\n\nNow we can get QIIME to make its famous barplots! You will see these in many, many microbiome papers.\n\n```         \nqiime taxa barplot \\\n  --i-table table.qza \\\n  --i-taxonomy taxonomy.qza \\\n  --m-metadata-file sample-metadata.tsv \\\n  --o-visualization taxa-bar-plots.qzv\n```\n\nDownload the qzv and have a play with the options!\n\n## Diversity exploration\n\nQIIME will also compute a lot of other statistics on your data. I personally prefer to do this in R, but for the sake of completeness let's also look at the QIIME output (I admit, some of it is quite pretty).\n\n```         \nqiime diversity core-metrics \\\n  --i-table table.qza \\\n  --p-sampling-depth 1103 \\\n  --m-metadata-file sample-metadata.tsv \\\n  --output-dir core-metrics-results\n  \nqiime emperor plot \\\n  --i-pcoa core-metrics-results/bray_curtis_pcoa_results.qza \\\n  --m-metadata-file sample-metadata.tsv \\\n  --p-custom-axes days-since-experiment-start \\\n  --o-visualization core-metrics-results/bray-curtis-emperor-days-since-experiment-start.qzv\n```\n\nLook at the three 'emporor' qzvs. What can you conclude about the samples? What are the most important determinants of microbial community composition?\n\n## References\n\nBokulich NA, Kaehler BD, Rideout JR, et al.
